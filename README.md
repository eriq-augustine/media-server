mediaserver
============

A web frontend to a media server.

If you want the version that does encoding, use the `encode` branch.
To simplify, encoding and cache work has been dropped.

# Configuration

You can see a full sample configuration file in code/config/config-sample.json.

If you are binding to a low port (like 80 or 443), then you may want to use something like setcap so you don't have to the entire server as root.

```
setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/mediaserver
```

# User Management

Users are managed through a json configuration file ("usersFile" in the configuration file).
Password hashes are stored in this file, so you should never share it.

There is currently no way to manage users online, but you can use the supplied manage-users utility to manage them.
Invoking the utility with no arguments will give you the usage.
